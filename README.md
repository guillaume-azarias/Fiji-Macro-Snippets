# Fiji-Macro-Snippets
*Set of simple tools to custom to make the life of imaging scientist easier*

Manual processing of images can be time-consumming, sometime impossible in the case of high content screening.
Fiji provides the possibility to apply image processing tasks in macro that are easy to combine.

Here I provide a set of simple tools to customise to your images and provide a basis to learn basic functions.

### Autothreshold_and_Tile
*Application*: When several images are open with Fiji, we often want to align them and optimize the contrast for a quick overview

*What it does*: Optimize the contrast for each images and align them using the tile function

*Advantage*: Allow to quickly screen a high number of images in a single function

### Closeit
*Application*: When several images are open with Fiji, including B&C, Log, Results, etc and you want to close everything at once

*What it does*: Close all open windows, select and close "Log", "Results", "Synchronize Windows", "B&C", "Threshold" and "ROI Manager"

*Advantage*: Allow to clean your screen instantly. Usefull when called through the toolbar

### Plate_annotation
*Application*: Titration/screening experiment

*What it does*: Annotate the number of cells and plasmid or virus concentration

*Advantage*: Save your file with the relevant information and avoid losing information

### Removing background from an image series
*Application*: Remove the background fluorescence from an image series

*What it does*: Substract the background

*Advantage*: Necessary step for image processing. Mind the acquisition settings.

### Save and close all images
*Application*: Save all the open images at once

*What it does*: Save the images as tiff, in the order they were open

*Advantage*: Usefull for parameter testing
