# Fiji-Macro-Snippets
*Set of simple tools to custom to make the life of imaging scientist easier*

Manual processing of images can be time-consumming, sometime impossible in the case of high content screening.
Fiji provides the possibility to apply image processing tasks in macro that are easy to combine.

Here I provide a set of simple tools to customise to your images and provide a basis to learn basic functions.

### Autothreshold_and_Tile
*Application*: When several images are open with Fiji, we often want to align them and optimize the contrast for a quick overview
*What it does*: Optimize the contrast for each images and align them using the tile function
*Advantage*: Allow to quickly screen a high number of images in a single function

### Plate_annotation
*Application*: Titration/screening experiment
*What it does*: Annotate the number of cells and plasmid or virus concentration
*Advantage*: Save your file with the relevant information and avoid losing information.
